Bugs
====
* Negative numbers in arrays (the minus symbol conflicts with the context)
	* Possible solutions: 
		* Use a * for context âˆš (done, but I don't like it)
		* Change the grammar


Features
========
* Improve debugging output with a line and char position
* Implement ron/main.m
* Add parsing/writing options and methods from NSJSONSerialization
* Replace NSScanner with a streaming scanner (the current implementation is sucky for large files)


Ideas (i.e. possible TODOs)
===========================
* Add =* to the grammar so that it can be used to underline words and create pseudo headings

* Augment context terminator, -, with + to allow - in keys
	* What does mark down use for lists items?
