Features
========
- Improve debugging output with a line and char position
- Implement ron/main.m
- Add parsing/writing options and methods from NSJSONSerialization
- Replace NSScanner with a streaming scanner (the current implementation is sucky for large files)


Ideas (i.e. possible TODOs)
===========================
- Add =- to the grammar so that it can be used to underline words and create pseudo headings

- Augment context terminator, -, with + to allow - in keys
	- What does mark down use for lists items?
