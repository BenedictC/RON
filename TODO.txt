Bugs
====
- Negative numbers in arrays (the minus symbol conflicts with the context)
	Solutions: 
		- Use a * for context
		- Change the grammar


Features
========
- Improve debugging output with a line and char position
- Implement ron/main.m
- Add parsing/writing options from NSJSONSerialization


Ideas (i.e. possible TODOs)
===========================
- Add =* to the grammar so that it can be used to underline words and create pseudo headings

- Augment context terminator, -, with + to allow - in keys
	- What does mark down use for lists items?
